Covid is here, lockdown just started and we all at home.

Time to analyse how I end up here.

Been in a regular school until year 11. Quit school on that year as I was a bit lost on my future goals and I found a job in hospitality – maybe I could do with a parental figure at this point to guide me.
But that’s a story for another day
 
Well, if I was doing this job, I wanted to do it properly! 

I enrolled myself on a 3 years course to become a professional hospitality technician.  In there I studied math, languages, psychology, philosophy, economics,
politics, etc. was not expecting that but it was really good for my personal development. Apart of this I studied bar and restaurant. In there we have theorical 
and technical classes for bar, making cocktails, learn different kinds of drinks, mix them, methods for work, etc. on a restaurant level we learn about different
foods, how they are made, we studied wine, protocols, etc. at the same time I was working on the weekends and evening to support my studies and make a living. 
The good part was I could apply everything that I’ve learn on a daily basis. Meet some amazing people at school, and at work. I didn’t know how to open a bottle of
wine (never had to, was embarrassed to ask for help), but someone just reach into me and show me the “how to”. Not just that, I’ve spent the whole summer learning 
from him. When I came back to school, I found myself better prepared and more open to learn and implement new knowledge. 

To wrap it up, I finish the course with 15/20 score (could be more, but I was skyping classes like crazy, was lazy on my assignments always delivery then late, not participating in classes, etc). 
For my final project I wrote a book about “Wines from Douro”. Was the only thing I delivered on time! 

After this I worked as a waiter for more than a year, enjoyed every second, but it wasn’t enough for me.

Decided to go to Uni! A new challenge. The plan when I was a kid was to go to Uni, but since I quit regular school, count go to the one I wanted, Computer science. 
So, since I also loved hospitality I went to “Hospitality Management”.

Was great! New people, new faces, new friends. 

The issue was – everything they were teaching I already knew! The only thing that was a “challenge” was the Management classes. Had a talk with the director, he asked 
me what was my plan, so I told him about my dream to live and work in UK. He smiles and said that I was wasting my time there. He told me to start from the bottom in a job, and work my way up since I’ve got the knowledge.

So I did!

Moved to UK in the middle of my second year at uni. Started to work in a pub (was different, so I wanted to give it a go). Then, a new restaurant opened in town. Perfect opportunity! I joined as a waiter. 

After working there for 6 months I was team leader, after 6 more months was promoted to supervisor. No more waiter, manager time started here.

Proved to be a great asset to the team, so after 6 more months was promoted to Assistant Manager.

I put my heart and soul at that restaurant. 6 more months and I was Assistant General Manager. Finally, just one more step to go. My GM, also became very good friends, left for another restaurant, so a 
new one came in. I gave my best to give him my support, it didn’t work well. He didn’t put the effort so the restaurant started to decline. After a year I was offered the position of Holding GM. I took it! 
Had 3 months to prove that I could do the job. Not going to lie, I was exhausted every day. Working from 7 am till 9 am, no days of. Oh man, but if that paid of! 
The team was happier, the sales were going on the right direction. 

But it was a bit to late. The company decided to close this restaurant. But they offered me a bigger one to manage???!!! I prove them I was a great choice to lead a team.

So, I end up in a monster of a restaurant. Manage to hire a great team, raise the profits, and above all, had hight costumer service standards implemented. 

One day I woke up, covid news everywhere… my biggest fear was to lose my team. 

And it happens, covid hit the UK and everyone was sent home. I knew that we would never go back.

During this time, I reflected a lot about my life. 30 years old, never have time for family or friends, always working weekends. Gave up days of if I need to.

Do I want this forever? The answer its no. I need a challenge, I can do much more! 

What do I LOVE to do? Gamming, play guitar, work with computers and programs, rebuild consoles, learn learn learn… ok, computer it is. What would I love to do? Make things work. Great, how do things work? By programming. 

So, codding it is. I’ve started to learn at my own pace, started to enjoy it, but not loving it. Until… I took the decision to join a bootcamp. Asked a friend for advice, 
he guided me to makers. Uff… expensive. But it will be worth it! So, I register myself. 

Got a phone call to discuss the next steps, I need to learn ruby. Never heard.

Uau! That’s something that I love to do! Making things!! 

Had to complete an online course and do some katas at code wars. It was a challenge, not enough time. But I did it. Ok, interview its booked. I was so nervous. 

Interview day, I passed! First step done!!!

Tomorrow the Pre-Course Starts!
